# First Part
# 1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
# Reading data from file
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
# 2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your
# analysis
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
# Cleaning the data from na values
cleanData <- subset(data,steps!="NA")
#  Previous Analysis
# head(cleanData)
# tail(cleanData)
# summary(cleanData)
# Second Part
# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
# 2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
# getting the means
mean_by_date <- tapply(cleanData$steps, cleanData$date, mean)
# 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(mean_by_date, col="red", main = "Means Histogram",xlab = "Days") # graph to find the histogram
# getting the medians
median_by_date <- tapply(cleanData$steps, cleanData$date,median)
titles <- c("day","mean","median")
Report1 <- cbind(names(mean_by_date),as.vector(mean_by_date),as.vector(median_by_date))
colnames(Report1) <- titles
head(Report1) ; tail(Report1)
Report1 <- as.data.frame(Report1)
Report1$day <- as.Date(Report1$day, "%Y-%m-%d")
Report1$mean <- mean_by_date
Report1$median <- median_by_date
Report1 # This is to show the table with the mean and median for day
# Third Part
# What is the average daily activity pattern?
# 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
mean_by_interval <- tapply(cleanData$steps, cleanData$date, mean)
plot(names(mean_by_interval),as.vector(mean_by_interval), type = "l" , main = "5-minute interval Vs average number of steps taken", xlab = "5-minute interval" , ylab="Mean by Interval" , col = 4)
# 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
names(which(mean_by_interval==max(mean_by_interval)))
# Fourth Part
# Imputing missing values
# Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.
# 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
sum(is.na(data$steps))
# 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
# data$stepsNew <- ifelse(is.na(data$steps),
#                         mean_interval[as.character(data$interval[which(is.na(data$steps))])],
#                         data$steps)
naIndices <- which(is.na(data$steps))
dataCopy <- data # Copio el set de datos original
naIntervalsTreated <- dataCopy$interval[naIndices]

dataCopy$steps)
dataCopy$steps[naIndices] <- mean_by_interval
(filledMedianDate <- tapply(dataCopy$steps, dataCopy$date,median))
(filledMeanInterval <- tapply(dataCopy$steps, dataCopy$date, mean))
hist(filledMeanInterval, col="blue", main = "Means Histogram recalculated",xlab = "Days") # graph to find the histogram
# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
